# VidentiUI

### A UI library targeting real-time applications, with elements specified using Lua.

Features (current and planned):

* In-built basic object types (buttons, sliders, etc.) and custom looks for them
* Support for custom rendering backends and wide cross-platform support
* Lua scripts specifying UI objects and their properties

Goals:

* Fast
* Reliable (i.e. prefers null objects and error logs rather than crashing)
* Ease of use and extensibility
* Suited to games, not websites
