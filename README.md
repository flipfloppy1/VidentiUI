# VidentiUI

### A UI library targeting real-time applications, with elements specified using only JSON.

Features (current and planned):

* Common object types (Buttons, sliders, textures, etc)
* Support for custom rendering backends and wide cross-platform support
* Nelua scripting integration (maybe)

Goals:

* Fast
* Reliable (i.e. prefers null objects and error logs rather than crashing)
* Ease of use and extensibility
* Suited to games, not websites
